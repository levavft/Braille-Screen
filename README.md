# Braille-Screen
Creating a modern Braille-Screen for more than reading.


The goal is to create different brial screens for different usages. 

If combining them will be possible, thats a bonus.

The first screen should be for programming, its fine if it will only work with a specific set of IDE's, or even one idea & language at the start.

Since braille book readers exist, its a matter of figuring out the differences between reading a book and programming, and adding relevant functionality.

Work methodology:

1. Bodging (see vid on the art of the bodge) is very welcome here. Speed and simplicity take priority.
2. Issues - When an idea comes to mind, open an issue about it. When doing new research - open an issue about it.
